Tursim is a content management system with a window-based visual interface, equipped with a graphical simulator for automata, Mealy machines, and Turing machines.

On the client side, it is entirely developed in JavaScript. The interface is defined through JSON, using a simple and easily extensible language.

The server is currently implemented in PHP, but since communication with the client also takes place via JSON, it can potentially be implemented in other languages as well.

Tursim relies on the file system and Linux system users, eliminating the need for a database. It can also make use of users and files already present on the system.

It includes a file explorer with copy, move, delete, and directory creation features. A recycle bin is also available, which preserves different versions of files, including those that have been overwritten.

Basic collaboration features are supported through the creation of user groups. A simple style selector allows adding, removing, and reordering CSS stylesheets.

Originally designed for educational purposes, Tursim combines simplicity, speed, and extensibility, qualities that also make it a potential lightweight alternative to more complex CMS platforms.
